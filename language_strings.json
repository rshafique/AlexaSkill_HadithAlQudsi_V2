And he reviled Me and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: He will not remake me as He made me at first - and the initial creation [of him] is no easier for Me than remaking him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> has taken to Himself a son, while I am the One, the Everlasting Refuge. I begot not nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me. i.e., bring me back to life after death.

When the Prophet (may the blessings and peace of <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> be upon him) finished, he faced the people and said to them: Do you know what your Lord has said? They said: <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> and his Messenger know best. He said: This morning one of my servants became a believer in Me and one a disbeliever. As for him who said: We have been given rain by virtue of <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> and His mercy, that one is a believer in Me, a disbeliever in the stars; and as for him who said: We have been given rain by such-and-such a star, that one is a disbeliever in Me, a believer in the stars. The pre-Islamic Arabs believed that rain was brought about by the movement of stars. This Hadith draws attention to the fact that whatever be the direct cause of such natural phenomena as rain, it is <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> the Almighty who is the Disposer of all things.

"On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> be pleased with him) from the Prophet peace be upon him, who said: <voice name=\"Brian\"><lang xml:lang=\"en-GB\"> <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> (glorified and exalted be He) has supernumerary angels who rove about seeking out gatherings in which <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme>'s name is being invoked: they sit with them and fold their wings round each other, filling that which is between them and between the lowest heaven.

He says: And what do they ask of Me? They say: They ask of You Your Paradise. He says: And have they seen My Paradise? They say: No, O Lord.

He says: And have they seen My Hell-fire? They say: NO. He says: And how would it be were they to have seen My Hell-fire: They say: And they ask for Your forgiveness. He (the Prophet peace be upon him) said: Then He says: I have forgiven them and I have bestowed upon them what they have asked for, and I have granted them sanctuary from that from which they asked protection.

If he makes mention of Me to himself, I make mention of him to Myself; and if he makes mention of Me in an assembly, I make mention of him in an assembly better than it. And if he draws near to Me an arm's length, I draw near to him a cubit, and if he draws near to Me a cubit, I draw near to him a fathom. And if he comes to Me walking, I go to him at speed. (1) Another possible rendering of the Arabic is: I am as My servant expects Me to be. The meaning is that forgiveness and acceptance of repentance by the Almighty is subject to His servant truly believing that He is forgiving and merciful.

"On the authority of Anas (may <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> be pleased with him) from the Prophet peace be upon him, who said: <voice name=\"Brian\"><lang xml:lang=\"en-GB\"> The believers will gather together on the Day of Resurrection and will say: Should we not ask [someone] to intercede for us with our Lord? So they will come to Adam and will say: You are the Father of mankind; <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> created you with His hand, He made His angels bow down to you and He taught you the names of everything, so intercede for us with your Lord so that He may give us relief form this place where we are. And he will say: I am not in a position [to do that] - and he will mention his wrongdoing and will feel ashamed and will say: Go to Noah, for he is the first messenger that <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> sent to the inhabitants of the earth. So they will come to him and he will say: I am not in a position [to do that] - and he will mention his having requested something of his Lord about which he had no [proper] knowledge (Quran Chapter 11 Verses 45-46), and he will feel ashamed and will say: Go to the Friend of the Merciful (Abraham). So they will come to him and he will say: I am not in a position [to do that]. Go to Moses, a servant to whom <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> talked and to whom He gave the Torah. So they will come to him and he will say: I am not in a position [to do that] - and he will mention the taking of a life other that for a life (Quran Chapter 28 Verses 15-16), and he will feel ashamed in the sight of his Lord and will say: Go to Jesus, <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme>'s servant and messenger, <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme>'s word and spirit. So they will come to him and he will say: I am not in a position [to do that]. Go to Muhammad (may the blessings and peace of <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> be upon him), a servant to whom <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> has forgiven all his wrongdoing, past and future. So they will come to me and I shall set forth to ask permission to come to my Lord, and permission will be given, and when I shall see my Lord I shall prostrate myself. He will leave me thus for such time as it pleases Him, and then it will be said [to me]: Raise your head. Ask and it will be granted. Speak and it will be heard. Intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So I shall raise my head and praise Him with a form of praise that He will teach me. Then I shall intercede and He will set me a limit [as to the number of people], so I shall admit them into Paradise. Then I shall return to Him, and when I shall see my Lord [I shall bow down] as before. Then I shall intercede and He will set me a limit [as to the number of people]. So I shall admit them into Paradise. Then I shall return for a third time, then a fourth, and I shall say: There remains in Hell-fire only those whom the Qur'an has confined and who must be there for eternity. There shall come out of Hell-fire he who has said: There is no god but <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> and who has in his heart goodness weighing a barley-corn; then there shall come out of Hell-fire he who has said: There is no god but <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> and who has in his heart goodness weighing a grain of wheat; then there shall come out of Hell-fire he who has said: There is no god but <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> and who has in his heart goodness weighing an atom.

"On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> peace be upon him said: <voice name=\"Brian\"><lang xml:lang=\"en-GB\"> <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> said: I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has seen and no ear has heard, not has it occurred to human heart. Thus recite if you wish (1): And no soul knows what joy for them (the inhabitants of Paradise) has been kept hidden (Quran Chapter 32 Verse 17). The words Thus recite if you wish are those of Abu Harayrah.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: So he came to it and looked at it and at what <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> had prepared therein for its inhabitants. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: So he returned to Him and said: By your glory, no one hears of it without entering it. So He ordered that it be encompassed by forms of hardship, and He said: Return to it and look at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: So he returned to it and found that it was encompassed by forms of hardship. Then he returned to Him and said: By Your glory, I fear that no one will enter it. He said: Go to Hell-fire and look at it and what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants, and he found that it was in layers, one above the other. Then he returned to Him and said: By Your glory, no one who hears of it will enter it. So He ordered that it be encompassed by lusts. Then He said: Return to it. And he returned to it and said: By Your glory, I am frightened that no one will escape from entering it. The Arabic word used here is makarih, the literal meaning of which is things that are disliked. In this context it refers to forms of religious discipline that man usually finds onerous. It was related by Tirmidhi, who said that it was a good and sound Hadith (also by Abu Dawud and <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"an-Nasaji\"> an-Nasa'i </phoneme>). </lang></voice>",
"On the authority of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (may <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> peace be upon him said: <voice name=\"Brian\"><lang xml:lang=\"en-GB\"> Paradise and Hell-fire disputed together, and Hell-fire said: In me are the mighty and the haughty. Paradise said: In me are the weak and the poor. So <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɑl-llɑh\"> Allah </phoneme> judged between them, [saying]: You are Paradise, My mercy; through you I show mercy to those I wish. And you are Hell-fire, My punishment; through you I punish those I wish, and it is incumbent upon Me that each of you shall have its fill.
